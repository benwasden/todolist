# To-Do List

This is a simple reminders application written in C++. Users can create new reminders and file them under General, Home, Personal, or Work categories. They can also see all listed reminders along with which ones are completed. Additionally, users can look up specific lists and edit reminders within each list. The user can choose to also delete all completed reminders from their system so they only have to focus on unfinished tasks.


I worked on this so I could learn C++. My experience prior to this was limited to JIT and I wanted to practice AOT by starting to learn C++. I have a lot to learn - this language was a bit of a challenge for me to fumble my way through, but I can already see why it's still used so frequently.

# Future Work - Things to Improve

- Item 1: User entry was a substantial hurdle and I still don't fully understand it.
- Item 2: Use JSON instead of CSV for goals and reminders.
- Item 3: Structs were useful for the couple of times I utilized them. I could definitely have used them more often and replaced some of the vectors I used in other places.
